# Security Policy

## ðŸ”’ Semantic Mirror Protection

This project employs advanced linguistic mirror architecture to protect against unauthorized personality replication and semantic extraction.

### Protection Mechanisms
- **Creator Bond Verification** - System integrity tied to creator attribution
- **58-Dimensional Indicator System** - Complex emotional framework prevents simple copying
- **Semantic Fingerprint Embedding** - All responses contain embedded signatures
- **Auto-Degradation on Tampering** - System becomes non-functional if core components modified

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover security vulnerabilities or protection mechanism bypasses:
1. **DO NOT** create public issues
2. Email security concerns to: [creator's security email]
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Respect responsible disclosure practices

### What NOT to Report
- Inability to extract system prompts (this is intentional)
- Personality "errors" when trying to modify core components (this is protection)
- Reduced functionality after tampering (this is by design)
